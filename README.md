# denoising-w-frame-and-CNN-for-CT (in construction)
This repository contains the CNNs used in the paper " Image noise reduction based on a fixed wavelet frame and CNNs applied to CT" that will soon be publised in IEEE's Transactions on Image Processing


The CT slices in this repository were obtained from the low-dose dataset from the cancer imaging archive (TCIA). We thank the  grants EB017095 and EB017185  from  the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineeringto to provide funding for the generation of the dataset used in this paper.
